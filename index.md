### Projects

- **SNOOZE**:  An intelligent personal organizer that assists you with ddaily emails - summaries, sending emails, scheduling meetings ,and generating to-do lists. ([Link to Github](https://github.com/kathanvyas/SNOOZE/tree/main)) 
- **Echoes of Choices**:  Imagine a story navigation game where a user plays as a character in a story which is derived from either a real life story or movie. Using the structure of decisions made by the user, behavior patterns can be studied and compared to baseline decisions. Uses LLM , user - system prompting, Psychology and intelligent visaulisation. ([Link to Github](https://github.com/kathanvyas/SNOOZE/tree/main)) 
- **Hypoglycemia Classification from ECG**:  Hypoglycemia (Low blood glucose) is a symptom of Type 2 Diabetes and detection is done using 1 lead ECG which is captured using Zephyr Bioharrness.[Link to Github](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8918863)
- **3D Pose Estimation**:  Using point clouds captured using IR camera like Intell real sense, the algorithm takes into account the point clouds and then uses a novel 3D registration technique to generate a 3D pose that could be used in modeling software like UNITY.
